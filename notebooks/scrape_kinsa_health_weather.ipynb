    "# Kinsa Health Weather data scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinsa is a company that makes Internet-connected thermometers and publishes the subsequent temperature readings in a \"US Health Weather Map\": https://healthweather.us/?mode=Atypical. Such readings can be classified as an illness when the user has a fever, and from there Kinsa uses an epidemiological model (https://content.kinsahealth.com/covid-detection-technical-approach) to estimate observed %-illness vs what would be expected under their model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has been praised as a pretty decent measure of flu and COVID-19 outbreaks, so below we present a scraper that extracts timeseries data for the \"observed\" and \"atypical\" rates of illness published on the US Health Weather Map website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use:\n",
    "1. Please see the README.md for all package/software requirements.\n",
    "2. In code cell 2, select a state with the IPython notebook widget in code cell number 2. Selecting \"(all)\", the default, will scrape every county's timeseries data across all US states and territories.\n",
    "3. Continue running the code cells. The scraped data will be saved to a .csv file in the `data` directory."
